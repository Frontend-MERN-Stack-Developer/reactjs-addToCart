I developed an eCommerce web application using ReactJS and Context API.

State Management => Used Context API to manage global state, allowing direct access to data in any component.

Product Listings => Displays dynamic products with real-time updates, fetching data from an API.

Add to Cart => Users can add/remove items, with total items and total cost calculations implemented, ensuring a smooth checkout process.

Responsive Design => I did not focus on responsiveness in this project, as I have been working on responsive design for the past 13 years.

Learning Focus => Currently enhancing my skills by learning the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) stack.

My name is Tasawar Mahmood, and I am currently building real-world full-stack development experience in the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js) through hands-on projects and continuous learning for the past 6+ months.

I bring 13+ years of frontend development expertise (React, Angular, Vue.js), with a strong foundation in UI/UX, responsive design, and modern JavaScript frameworks.

Over the past 6+ months, I’ve been actively working on MERN stack projects, implementing authentication, CRUD operations, RESTful APIs, and integrating MongoDB Atlas for database management. I’m focused on gaining practical, production-level experience and staying aligned with modern best practices.
